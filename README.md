# Project-Management-System
Welcome to the repository for our Project Management System. Here you will find all source code for this project. This application is being devloped in C#, and will utilize
Avalonia to develop the User Interface, with NUnit to create basic unit tests to ensure a quality product. This is the second repository for this project, we had to move in order to
more easily switch to Reactive UI. The original repository, and older commits can be found [here](https://github.com/straitonrj/Project-Management-System).

## Project Description
Our Project Management system will be a desktop application which will allow users to track various software development projects easily and efficiently. The system will allow users to keep track of 
functional and non-functional requirements, allow monitoring of project efforts across development phases, and generate reports on time costs. Our goal is to give our users a simple way of monitoring 
many of their software development projects. Whether those projects be academic, personal, or industry related, our system will help supervise the notoriously difficult software development process. 
For a more detailed look at the project, please take a look at our [Comprehensive Plan](./documentation/ComprehensivePlan.pdf).
